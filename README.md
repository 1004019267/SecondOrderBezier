# SecondOrderBezier
SecondOrderBezier is algorithm on Unity5.6.2

it only a algorithm with SecondOrderBezier and I use the diffenene value to get the mid point position

the mid position was between the startPoint and endPoint and it lived half of the all size position ,you can set it high，but it only used in 2D ,if you want to use 3D please change it.
